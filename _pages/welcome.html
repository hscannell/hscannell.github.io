<p>Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the <a href="https://ocean-transport.github.io/cds_lab.html" title="https://ocean-transport.github.io/cds_lab.html" target="_blank">Climate Data Science Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/" title="https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory</a>, which is part of the Earth Institute at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" title="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>. Our research group is led by Ryan Abernathey with funding from the <a href="https://www.moore.org/" title="https://www.moore.org/" target="_blank">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</a> and collaboration with the <a href="http://pangeo.io/" title="http://pangeo.io/" target="_blank">Pangeo Project</a>.</p>
<p>I recently received my PhD from the School of Oceanography at the University of Washington under the advisement of LuAnne Thompson. My dissertation focused on the spatiotemporal evolution of marine heatwaves globally and developed a novel tracking algorithm called Ocetrac to characterize dangerous marine heatwaves</p>

<strong>18 June 2020:</strong> AI for Earth Innovation Grant Supports Marine Heatwave Research. Our proposal to track and forecast dangerous marine heatwaves was selected among 135 globally to receive one of five AI for Earth Innovation Grants from <b>Microsoft-Global Wildlife Conservation and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation</b>. Check out the official <a href="https://www.globalwildlife.org/press/winners-of-ai-for-earth-innovation-grants-poised-to-address-urgent-environmental-challenges-with-creative-use-of-technology/" title="https://www.globalwildlife.org/press/winners-of-ai-for-earth-innovation-grants-poised-to-address-urgent-environmental-challenges-with-creative-use-of-technology/" target="_blank">press release</a> and the UW College of the Environment <a href="https://environment.uw.edu/news/2020/06/uw-school-of-oceanography-student-won-microsoft-global-wildlife-conservation-earth-innovation-grant/" title="https://environment.uw.edu/news/2020/06/uw-school-of-oceanography-student-won-microsoft-global-wildlife-conservation-earth-innovation-grant/" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>28 Jan 2020:</strong> Received an Advanced Studies Program (ASP) Graduate Visitor Fellowship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. I will be working with Daniel Whitt and David John Gagne to use machine learning to track marine heatwaves in large climate model datasets.</p>

<p><strong>13 Nov 2019:</strong> Awarded Microsoft AI for Earth grant to study marine heatwaves. Marine heatwaves are becoming ubiquitous features of our changing oceans that seem to reoccur in some regions more frequently than others. <a href="https://eos.org/features/why-is-the-gulf-of-maine-warming-faster-than-99-of-the-ocean" title="https://eos.org/features/why-is-the-gulf-of-maine-warming-faster-than-99-of-the-ocean" target="_blank">Why, you might ask?</a> To answer this we proposed to use Microsoft Azure to integrate AI tools with petabyte-sized climate model data to identify and map ocean regions most susceptible to marine heatwaves in past, present, and future climates. </p>

<p><strong>27 May 2018:</strong> Thrilled to be selected as one of the recipients of the 2018 <a href="https://www.integral-corp.com/big-data-university-of-washington-students-awarded-integral-fellowships/" title="https://www.integral-corp.com/big-data-university-of-washington-students-awarded-integral-fellowships/" target="_blank">Integral Consulting Inc. Environmental Big Data Research Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p><strong>16 Aug 2017:</strong> Our Policy Brief on Climate Change Wins International Competition in The New York Times! We proposed a framework to bring together Washington, Oregon and California to improve harmful algal bloom prediction, information sharing, economic mitigation and response. The overall goal of our policy brief was to continue to protect public health while sustaining vibrant West Coast communities.
