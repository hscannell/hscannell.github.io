## [Ocetrac](https://ocetrac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

Ocetrac is a small python package that uses morphological image processing to label and track geophysical anomalies. It was developed as a tool to study the spatiotemporal evolution of **[marine heatwaves](https://www.hillaryscannell.com/research/)**, which are extreme, persistant, and large-scale warming events at the sea surface.
